                    But seriously, this is a really interesting question! If you 
                    grew up with parents that cooked often—like we did—or grew up eating 
                    out at Italian restaurants basically anywhere in America (hello, Olive Garden)
                     you’re probably kind of familiar with “chicken piccata” as we mean it—a 
                     pan-fried chicken cutlet, topped with a lemon-butter piccata sauce. BUT! 
                     Chicken piccata as we know it doesn’t actually seem to have origins in Italy. 
                     It’s likely an Italian-American invention, a derivative of a couple of different 
                     classic Italian cooking techniques, like scaloppine which means “thin slices of 
                     meat (such as veal) sautéed or coated with flour and fried”. A lemon and butter
                      pan sauce is a classic way of dressing pan-fried meat, and is common throughout
                       Italy, but the (brilliant) addition of capers can’t be attributed to any one 
                       place or time. However and whenever it came into being, chicken piccata is—as 
                       far as we’re concerned—a very welcome addition to any home cook’s repertoire.

                <p class="blog-content-p"><b>STEP 1</b><br>
                    Melt half the butter in a large frying pan over a medium heat and gently wilt the spinach, about 2-3 mins. Stir and season well. Remove to a colander to drain.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-content-p"><b>STEP 2</b><br>
                     If any liquid remains in the pan, pour it away and wipe it out. Melt the rest of the butter in the same pan over a medium heat, swirling it so the base of the pan is covered. Fry the chicken for 1-2 mins, stirring until lightly golden. Season well. Add the garlic and fry for 1 min more, then pour in the cream and simmer for 15 mins, stirring often until the chicken has cooked through – be careful not to let the cream boil.
                </p>
                <p class="blog-content-p"><b>STEP 3</b><br>
                    Stir in 30g of the cheese and all the spinach, squeezing out any excess liquid first. Simmer for another 5 mins until the cheese has melted and the chicken is cooked through. To check the chicken is ready, pierce the thickest part of the meat to ensure the juices run clear.
                 </p>
                <p class="blog-content-p"><b>STEP 4</b><br>
                    Scatter with the remaining cheese and serve the chicken with plenty of the sauce, alongside rice or potatoes, if you like.
